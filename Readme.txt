Project Description:

Design a mechatronic device to assist with the delivery of letters within a building. 
The desired delivery location for each item will be indicated by a “destination code”. 
These codes will be centred on the right edge of a No. 10 (104.8 × 241.3 mm) envelope. 
Letters will be picked up and dropped off at mailboxes with in/out slots mounted on the 
wall (at a nominal height of 1.25 m) outside of each location. The mailboxes will 
incorporate LED markers.

It is expected that the device will operate autonomously. Navigation should be achieved 
using an internal “map” of known delivery locations in combination with real-time sensor 
data. The device should be able to move over any smooth floor and must be able to operate 
without painted/taped lines, markers, wires or any other installed guides. In addition, 
the design must incorporate features to ensure the safety of any bystanders who may come 
into proximity of the device. That is, the device must not drive into anyone or otherwise 
cause harm, but rather should stop and/or seek an alternate route.

The following items will be left to the discretion of each group:
> Map representation and method of input
> Letter capacity
> Handling of multiple deliveries
> Type and robustness of obstacle handling
